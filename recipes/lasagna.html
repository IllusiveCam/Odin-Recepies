            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        
        </ul>
        <h3>Filling</h3>

            <li>1 1/2 cups full-fat ricotta cheese (drained)</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon finely sliced fresh basil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated parmigiana-reggiana cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Lasagna</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups prepared marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup grated monterey jack cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon finely grated parmigiana-reggiana cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon basil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>preheat over to 450 F. Set out 4 small shallow oven-proof baking dishes or ramekins</li>
            <li>combine eggs, salt, olive oil, water and flour for pancakes in large bowl. Whisk thoroughly until very smooth, then let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Brush oil into a nonstick skillet and set heat to medium. When the skillet is hot, add about 1/4 cup batter and tilt the pan so it evenly coats the bottom. Cook until the batter sets and the top surface goes from looking wet to dry, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook the other side for 1 minute. Transfer to a plate and repeat to make remaining 3 pancakes. Cut each pancake into 3 triangles. </li>
            <li>Combine ricotta cheese, salt, pepper, cayenne, basil, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for filling in a bowl; mix with a fork until thoroughly combined. </li>
            <li>Prepare lasagnas: Spread 2 tablespoons marinara sauce into the bottom of each baking dish. Lay 1 pancake triangle on the sauce, then top with about 2 tablespoons ricotta filling, 1 tablespoon Monterey Jack cheese, and 2 teaspoons marinara. Repeat to create another layer, slightly pressing down on the second pancake triangle before topping with filling and cheese. Top with the remaining pancake triangle, pressing down slightly. Add remaining marinara and Monterey Jack, sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano, and drizzle with olive oil. </li>
            <li>Place the baking dishes on a large sheet pan and bake in the center of the preheated oven until lightly browned and bubbly, about 15 minutes. Let cool for about 5 minutes, then garnish with basil and serve. </li>
        </ol>
